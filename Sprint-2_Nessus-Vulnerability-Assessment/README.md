# üõ°Ô∏è Vulnerability Management and Patch Automation 

## üìò Overview
This project documents the **end-to-end vulnerability management process** carried out on a Linux server running Nginx.  
Using **Nessus** for vulnerability discovery and **Ansible** for patch automation, the team identified and remediated multiple security flaws.  
As the **team lead**, I coordinated technical execution, managed deliverables, and verified the remediation outcomes.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Discovery Phase**
- Conducted **credentialed SSH scans** and **web application scans** using Nessus.  
- Detected a manually compiled and outdated version of **Nginx 1.15.5** with several CVEs.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Assessment Phase**
- Reviewed findings in Nessus focusing on CVSS scores, exploitability, and patch availability.  
- Prioritized high and medium vulnerabilities for immediate remediation.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Remediation Phase**
- Developed and executed an **Ansible playbook (`update_nginx.yml`)** to automate patching.  
- Actions included:
  - Removing the outdated Nginx installation from `/usr/local/nginx/`.  
  - Installing the latest package-managed version (**Nginx 1.28.0**).  
  - Restarting and verifying the service.  

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Validation Phase**
- Conducted a **post-patch Nessus scan** confirming that all critical and high-severity vulnerabilities were resolved.  
- Verified the update through:
  ```bash
  nginx -v
  # nginx version: nginx/1.28.0

  ### Key Findings

| Risk Level | No. of Vulnerabilities | Status |
|-------------|-----------------------|---------|
| High        | 2                     | Resolved ‚úÖ |
| Medium      | 2                     | Resolved ‚úÖ |
| Info        | 1                     | Non-critical ‚öôÔ∏è |

### Individual Responsibilities

- Configured Nessus for both credentialed and web application scans.  
- Executed SSH-based vulnerability assessments using root privileges.  
- Created and tested the Ansible playbook for automated Nginx patching.  
- Resolved APT key verification errors by reinstalling `kali-archive-keyring (2025.1)`.  
- Performed post-remediation re-scans to validate patch success.  
- Led the group by assigning roles, coordinating meetings, and ensuring timely submissions.

### LetsDefend SOC Training

To complement the project, we were tasked with the following hands-on SOC analyst courses on **LetsDefend**:

- **SOC Fundamentals:** Improved understanding of SOC operations, alert triage, escalation procedures, and event correlation.  
- **Detecting Web Attacks 1:** Learned to identify suspicious HTTP requests, command injection patterns, and web shell activity using log analysis.  
- **Detecting Brute Force Attack:** Gained skills in detecting brute-force attempts through failed login patterns, IP correlation, and SIEM alerting thresholds.  

These courses strengthened my practical ability to **analyze alerts, recognize attack patterns**, and **respond effectively** to security incidents within a SOC environment.
